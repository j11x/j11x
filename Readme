# I am J11x and am literally on day 1 of using a Raspberry Pi4 from scratch
# Only have one clue as to what I am doing and that is that it took a day to learn
# That hash = Rem if you ever tooked a ZX spectrum
# feel like a cat being asked to fly a plane with all my eggs in that one plane...
# Any suggestions from anybody who can remember the humble beginnings and have a shread
# of empathy as to how deep the deep end felt on day 1 would be a fab starting point
# to chat and maybe make suggestions that does not envolve buying poorly labelled and
# utterly useless books likes 2020 beginners guide to get started!
# That book was only to put you pi together and nothing on commands or useful stuff
